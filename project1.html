    <p>Investigation of Heat Generation During Bobbin Tool Friction Stir Welding on Dissimilar Aluminum Alloy</p>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      This project focuses on the experimental investigation of heat generation during 
      <strong>Bobbin Tool Friction Stir Welding (BT-FSW)</strong> of dissimilar aluminum alloys. 
      The objective was to understand the influence of process parameters such as tool rotation speed 
      and welding speed on heat generation, material flow, and joint quality.
    </p>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>
      The work involved conducting welding experiments with different sets of process parameters. 
      Heat generation was measured using temperature sensors, while weld quality was examined through 
      metallurgical analysis and tensile strength testing. Data was compared across samples to establish 
      the effect of parameter variation.
    </p>

    <h2>Results & Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The study showed that higher tool rotational speeds increased heat input, improving material 
      mixing but also risking excess softening. Optimized process conditions led to defect-free welds 
      with acceptable mechanical properties. The project demonstrated that Bobbin Tool FSW is effective 
      for welding dissimilar aluminum alloys with reduced distortion compared to conventional methods.
